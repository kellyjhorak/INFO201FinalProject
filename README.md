# INFO201FinalProject Executive Summary

This project explores the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and various education-related indicators. The analysis uses a dataset that encompasses global economic and education data, aiming to reveal insights between economic prosperity and educational outcomes. Policymakers, educators, and students are our target audience as we hope the information derived from this analysis guides informed decision-making and targeted intitiatives to improve educational resources and opportunities in a global context. 

We compare the GDP per capita against completion rates and out-of-school rates for primary education, both for males and females, to identify both gender and educational disparities. We also highlight unemployment rates, which is another indicator for economic health, and provide a global perspective on economic disparities through a world map.
